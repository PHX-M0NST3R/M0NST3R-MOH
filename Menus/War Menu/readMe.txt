**UPDATES**

(20/03/24):

Changes:

- Added new style of crosshairs
- Added forcemodel toggleable option
- Added "SERVERS" section cus I have OCD
- Menu now creates a "M0NST3R-CROSSHAIR.cfg" in the players configs folder
  Any settings changed in the menu will be saved for next time player opens the game

Info:

- If you're going to select a Friendly Crosshair (Crosshair that shows when aiming at a teammate), make sure to select the "MAIN CROSSHAIR" first.
  The main crosshair selection will overwrite any previously selected "FRIENDLY CROSSHAIR" selections.

- If you don't wish to have a FRIENDLY CROSSHAIR, then the MAIN one you've selected will be shown constantly, whether or not you're aiming at a teammate.
